## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

Negative

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

AI will generate answers even if they are incorrect, so as OPenAi goes through these reviews it'll use contect clues to determine the sentiments for each review. This might result in errors especially for some of the more complicated and long reviews. The AI might determine usage of certain words like better. good, to fit into the 'positive' category, however the overall sentiment of the review could actually be the opposite. 

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

It seems that there are more negative reviews than positive so I would not recommend this Cocnut Water producer. Out of 50 reviews, 30 are cateogrized as negative meaning more than half of the people who've left reviews for this product were not satisified. A closer look at the negative comments might reveal a common theme that could then be addresed to improve the product.
